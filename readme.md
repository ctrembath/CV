I'm a front end developer and designer with a background in fine art. 

After completing a BA in Sculpture from the University of the Arts London (Camberwell College) - i decided to enroll at Makers Accademy to explore my interest in creative tech. 
Now a Makers Accademy Graduate, I am looking for a career in front-end development.
